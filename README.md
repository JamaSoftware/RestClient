## RestClient
RestClient is a Java REST API client application for Jama Software customers. The client will allow customers to easily access the REST API to retrieve, and modify data within their Jama Instance. 
The client will be continuously updated in hopes of creating a more robust client that addresses all endpoints available through the API.

Please note that this client is distributed as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.
