## RestClient
RestClient is a Java REST API client application for Jama Software customers. The client will allow customers to easily access the REST API to retrieve, and modify data within their Jama Instance. 
The client will be continuously updated in hopes of creating a more robust client that addresses all endpoints available through the API.

Please note that this client is distributed as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.

### How it works
1. All objects retrieved from Jama are associated via their id's to a `JamaInstance` object. This prevents the client from holding onto multiple versions of a given object. 
2. Once an object is retrieved from Jama, it has a lifetime equal to the `resourceTimeOut` value in the `jama.properties` file. This ensures users are always referencing the object's latest version as it exists in Jama.
3. When a user attempts to access any field within a `JamaDomainObject`, the client will determine whether or not to fetch the object from Jama. If the time since it's last fetch exceeds that of `resourceTimeOut`, then the item will be fetched.
4. The `resourceTimeOut` should be between 6 and 15 seconds. Less than 6 seconds can trigger too many fetches, whereas more than 15 seconds can lead to outdated data in the client. Users should attempt differenct values for their `resourceTimeOut` depending on their use case. 



## Requirements
- Module SDK `Java 1.8` or higher.
- Language level `7 - Diamonds, ARM, multi-catch etc.`



## Setup
1. As always, set up a test environment and project to test the script.

2. Fill out the CONFIG section of the jama.properties file.  The necessary fields are:
  - ```username```
  - ```password```
  - ```base_url```
  - ```resourceTimeOut```     - refresh time for items
  
3. Change the name of the `jama.properties.dist`  to  `jama.properties`
